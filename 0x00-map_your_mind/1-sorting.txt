reads in three numbers and writes them all in sorted order

LET N = [input of numbers]
LET STORAGE = []
FOR numberI in N
    IF STORAGE = []
        PUT number in STORAGE
    ELSE IF STORAGE != []
        FOR numberJ in STORAGE
            IF numberI < numberJ
                PUT numberI in front of numberJ in STORAGE
            ELSE
                PUT numberI in STORAGE
PRINT STORAGE
